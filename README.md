# Thermostat

Thermostat is a web app used for tracking and setting thermostat controls for a variety of different building units or houses. It was made using the parity api.

The app is live at https://thermostat-interface.netlify.app/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
